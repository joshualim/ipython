      "## Nuclear activity calculator\n",
      "Recently, I needed to send some samples containing uranium from overseas to the UK. Although I'm not interested in the nuclear or radioactive properties (I say why [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/joshualim/ipython/blob/master/20150302_UGa3_activity_calc/whyU.ipynb)), these samples are slightly radioactive. There are lots of safety precautions in place when dealing with radioactive materials, and one thing I had to do was to figure out how radioactive my samples might be. At the time, we didn't have a way to easily and reliably measure the activity so I tried to calculate it instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "These are quite simple calculations but there are quite a lot of steps. They only use the formulae for radioactive decay and some ideas about moles.\n",
      "\n",
      "## The problem\n",
      "\n",
      "In the end the quantity we want to calculate is the activity or decay rate. This has units of $s^{-1}$ and tells us how many decays there are per second. I was hoping that this number would be low - a low activity means that some of the safety constraints that make it more difficult to do experiments are relaxed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sample is made of UGa$_3$ and we are told by the person providing it that it is 4.06x1.38x1.40 mm in size and has a mass of 61.2 mg. Ga is stable and so all the activity comes from U. This is all the information we need to calculate the activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Approach\n",
      "\n",
      "I'll outline the important things we need to know beforehand\n",
      "\n",
      "* To calculate the activity, we will use the formula ${Activity} = \\lambda N$. This is a simple statement which says the activity depends on the decays constant ($\\lambda$) and the number of atoms, $N$. If we have a high decay constant, the activity will be high. Also if we have a large number of atoms, then we will have a high activity. \n",
      "\n",
      "* We need to know how many uranium atoms we have $N$. We can calculate this based on the sample mass and knowing the composition (i.e. how many U compared to Ga).\n",
      "\n",
      "* The decay constant we look up and just depends on what element we have. \n",
      "\n",
      "## Starting the calculation\n",
      "We will start by writing down what we know about the problem. I am doing this in ipython which allows me to see all the steps calculation. It also allows me to quickly repeat a calculation with a different input information (for example, the sample mass).\n"
